  - Enables proactive mitigation planning

- **Landscape Dashboard**

  - Compare landscape change over time (before/after and gif animation)
  - Support urban greening strategies and monitoring

- **Forecast Simulator**

  - Whatâ€‘if analysis with adjustable parameters
  - Explore future scenarios and their tradeâ€‘offs

- **Analyze**

  - Explore and interpret builtâ€‘in datasets and forecasts within the app (no file uploads)

- **Modern, Accessible UI**
  - Fast, responsive charts and components built with Radix UI + Recharts

## Who Is It For?

- City planners, utilities, and NGOs seeking dataâ€‘backed sustainability actions
- Researchers and students exploring ML for environmental decisionâ€‘support
- Homeowners and businesses evaluating longâ€‘term solar economics

## User Journeys

- "I want to know if solar makes sense for me": Open Solar Dashboard â†’ compare visuals â†’ view projected savings and 25â€‘year ROI under inflation â†’ decide when to invest
- "I need to monitor water health": Open Water Quality Dashboard â†’ review current trends and forecasted score â†’ prioritize interventions where predicted decline is highest
- "Iâ€™m planning green spaces": Open Landscape Dashboard â†’ compare before/after imagery or animation â†’ identify areas for greening and restoration

## Realâ€‘World Impact

- City planners and NGOs can prioritize interventions where they matter most
- Homeowners and businesses can time solar investments for maximal savings
- Water authorities can detect pollution trends early to reduce risk

## ðŸ¤– Machine Learning & Forecasting

We applied advanced statistical and machine learning models to forecast critical sustainability indicators, supporting dataâ€‘driven decisionâ€‘making across energy and environmental domains.

### ðŸ“ˆ Inflation Forecasting

To anticipate Egyptâ€™s inflation trends and highlight the economic advantage of early solar adoption, we employed:

- **ARIMA(1,1,0)**: Captures baseline inflation movements with quick fitting and easy interpretation.
- **SARIMAX**: An enhanced ARIMA model incorporating Interest Rate and Exchange Rate as exogenous factors, delivering more contextâ€‘aware and precise forecasts.

**Outcome**: The models demonstrate that inflation will gradually erode purchasing powerâ€”emphasizing that early solar investments secure longâ€‘term financial savings over the next 25 years.

### ðŸ’§ Water Quality Forecasting

For environmental sustainability, we utilized machine learning to predict water quality scores (0â€“100 scale) and enable proactive water resource management.

- **Best Model**: Random Forest Regressor
- **Performance**: RÂ² Score > 0.85, RMSE < 2.5
- **Key Features**: Turbidity, pH, Dissolved Oxygen, Fecal Coliform

**Outcome**: The model accurately forecasts water quality, allowing early pollution detection and informed decisionâ€‘making for sustainable water management.

## Architecture

- Frontend app in `Website/` built with React + TypeScript + Vite
- UI built from composable primitives (Radix UI) and responsive charts (Recharts)
- Styling with Tailwind CSS; utility helpers in `src/lib/`
- Routing with React Router; pages in `src/pages/`
- Data science notebooks and datasets live alongside the web app for transparent methodology

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18 or newer

### Install dependencies

```bash
cd Website
npm install
```

### Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Vite will print a local URL you can open in your browser.

### Build for production

## Deployment (Vercel)

This app is hosted on Vercel at the Live Demo link above. To deploy your own version:

1. Push this repository to GitHub/GitLab.
2. In Vercel, import the repository.
3. Set the project Root Directory to `Website` (monorepo setup).
4. Framework Preset: `Vite`. Build command: `npm run build`. Output dir: `dist`.
5. Deploy. Vercel will build from `Website` and host the static output.

## Roadmap

- Enrich geospatial layers and add mapâ€‘based analysis
- Expand forecasting inputs and model explainability
- Data upload templates and validation guidance
- Exportable reports and shareable scenario links
